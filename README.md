# UCSX-IMM-Ansible
Ansible playbooks for Build a  Intersight Managed UCSX  along with service profiles 

Summery :  These are a group of playbooks for Day 0 build for a Cisco UCSX till creation of service profiles. I found multiple referecens for UCSX deployment and they are part of bigger deployment hence sometime confusing . These playbooks are clean and for deploy UCSX related only. It uses Ansibles roles to stucture the codes. It also covers multiple scenarions for deploying service profiles
